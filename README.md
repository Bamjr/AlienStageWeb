# AlienStageWeb

**AlienStageWeb** is a fan-made website created to celebrate and share passion for the popular web series **Alien Stage**. This simple static page was developed and deployed by [Bamjr](https://github.com/Bamjr). Also This is the first website I built from scratch as a personal practice project.


⚠️ **Note:** This project is created for my own practice purpose only and is not affiliated with the official Alien Stage team.
